## Hi there 👋

I’m Sanjana, a computer science student who enjoys learning how systems work and building things end to end.

I work across frontend and backend, and spend a lot of time on data structures and problem solving. Most of my learning comes from building real projects and participating in hackathons, where I like turning ideas into things that actually work.

I’m curious about clean design, scalable systems, and getting better at my craft every day.

Let’s connect.
